Version 2.13.1 Tom Schoonjans

-Corrected radrate database: 2.13.0 was using scofield for K and campbell for
L instead of Krause data
-"make clean" now works properly


Version 2.13.0 Tom Schoonjans

-Expanded the radrate database (150 linetypes available now, including M lines)
-More line energies: the new database was calculated using the edge energy
database and contains every theoretical possible transition. 381 linetypes are
available
-Kissel database fixes: since the Kissel edge energies do not correspond to
the ones found in the edge energy database this could lead to unpredictable
behaviour near the edges. This has been fixed by using the Kissel calculated
edge energies.
-Compound parser: we have added a parser for compounds which will determine
information such as number of different elements, number of atoms per element
and weight fractions. This parser has been coupled with several cross section
functions.
-Refractive indices: we added two functions that calculate the real and
imaginary parts of the refractive index of a given compound.
-Numerous bugfixes: an important one would be the restoration of IDL support
on Mac OS X Snow Leopard
-Creation of IDL bindings rpm
-Added Java bindings (requires Sun JAVA compiler): works on Linux and Mac Os X
-Verified support on FreeBSD 8.0 64-bit

Version 2.12.1 Tom Schoonjans

Fixed bug in installation scripts that caused the perl and IDL bindings
compilation phase to fail under certain circumstances

Version 2.12 Tom Schoonjans 

Build system has changed completely: the new system is based on autoconf,
automake and libtool. Tests were conducted on different systems using
different compilers. An overview:
C-library: linux (Fedora 10 (gcc 4.3.2) and 11 (gcc 4.4.0), both 64-bit), Mac OS X (Leopard (gcc 4.0.1 and gcc 4.4.0) Intel 32-bit), Solaris 10 (Sun C 5.10 32-bit)
Fortran bindings: linux (Fedora 10 (gfortran 4.3.2) and 11 (gfortran 4.4.0), both 64-bit), Mac OS X (Leopard (gfortran 4.4.0, g95 and ifort) Intel 32-bit), Solaris 10 (Sun Fortran 95 8.4 32-bit)
Perl bindings: linux (Fedora 10 (perl 5.10.0) and 11 (perl 5.10.0), both 64-bit), Mac OS X (Leopard (perl 5.8.9) Intel 32-bit), Solaris 10 (perl 5.8.4 32-bit)
Python bindings and xraylib executable: linux (Fedora 10 (python 2.5) and 11 (python 2.6), both 64-bit), Mac OS X (Leopard (python 2.5) Intel 32-bit)
IDL bindings: linux (Fedora 10 (idl 7.1) 64-bit), Mac OS X (Leopard idl 7.0 Intel 32-bit)

A spec file and pkg-config files were added as well. RPM
packages were created for Fedora 10 and 11 x86_64 systems. 

Version 2.11 Tom Schoonjans

Complete rewrite of the IDL bindings, using the DLM approach.
Definition of the COMMON block XRAYLIB containing all the xraylib macros. This
has the advantage that these convenient variables can now be used inside
functions and procedures. An example is provided in xrlexample5.pro.

In order for IDL to find the XRayLib DLM at runtime it is necessary that the
user makes sure that the IDL_DLM_PATH environment variable points to the idl
subdirectory of the xraylib installation folder!

Version 2.10 Tom Schoonjans

Minor changes: adjusted the placing of xraylib.mod into lib for the gfortran
compiler
Definition of two macros in xraylib.h: XRL_VERSION_MAJOR and XRL_VERSION_MINOR
Recalculation (smoothing) of second derivatives of kissel cross section data. This was done to avoid erratic behaviour of interpolation near absorption edges.
Support for IDL bindings on Mac (Tested on an Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.4 and IDL 7.0)
Minor changes to install.sh: Python bindings disabled when running on Mac etc...

Version 2.9 Tom Schoonjans

Introduction of partial photoelectric cross sections (data of L. Kissel) ->
kissel_pe.dat
New functions were added based on these partial PE CS:
// Kissel Photoelectric cross sections
float CS_Photo_Total(int Z, float E);
float CSb_Photo_Total(int Z, float E);
float CS_Photo_Partial(int Z, int shell, float E);
float CSb_Photo_Partial(int Z, int shell, float E);

// XRF cross sections using Kissel partial photoelectric cross sections
float CS_FluorLine_Kissel(int Z, int line, float E);
float CSb_FluorLine_Kissel(int Z, int line, float E);

// Total cross sections (photoionization+Rayleigh+Compton) using Kissel Total
// photoelectric cross sections
float CS_Total_Kissel(int Z, float E);
float CSb_Total_Kissel(int Z, float E); 

The user is now given the opportunity to choose at installation time between
hardcoding the data or calling the data at run time with XRayInit. 

TODO: rewrite the IDL bindings completely in favor of the DLM approach,
recommended by IDL 


Version 2.8 Tom Schoonjans

All the physical data is now hardcoded during the compilation phase, making
the initialization at run time redundant. (Thanks to Teemu Ikonen for
contributing the code)
Added bindings for Perl and Fortran 2003. For use of the Fortran 2003, a
recent compiler like Intel Fortran 10.0, G95 or GFortran 4.3.0 is needed. 
The installation scripts are now gone and have been replaced by a Makefile
Partial support for Mac OS X -> C, C++ dynamic libraries compile and run, as
well as the Fortran and Perl bindings. The Python bindings do not work. The
IDL bindings have not been tested yet.
Examples for C shared libraries, Perl and Fortran bindings were added.
SWIG is now a requirement for using the Perl and Python bindings.
